# FluidDiff

This repository contains an implementation of **FluidDiff**, a diffusion-based model for fluid dynamics.  
The project includes dataset generation, model training, and example usage.

üìå Notes

Designed for fluid field simulations (e.g., velocity, pressure).

Trained on synthetic data generated with PhiFlow.

Achieved MAE = 0.1 after 40 epochs.

To predict future condition of fluid use `ddm.generate(n, diffusion_time, data)`, 
where `n` is amount of batches, `diffusion_time` is amount of diffusion steps during
sampling, `data` is TensorFlow Tensor (shape = (N, 64, 64, 4), where N is number of pictures,
the first and the second channels should be Noise, the third one - œÅ(0), the fourth one - 
64x64 matrix where each element = t/40 (t can be 1,...40; in fact it's simulation time))
